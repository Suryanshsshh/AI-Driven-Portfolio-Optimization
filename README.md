# 💼 AI-Driven Portfolio Optimization

An intelligent system to optimize financial portfolios using machine learning and statistical techniques. This project empowers investors and analysts to make data-driven decisions by balancing risk and return effectively.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a Python-based portfolio optimization tool that leverages **AI techniques** such as predictive modeling and optimization algorithms to create efficient portfolios based on historical stock data.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 🐍
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- CVXPY / PyPortfolioOpt (if used)
- Financial APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage)

---

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Fetch historical stock price data
- 📉 Calculate returns, volatility & Sharpe Ratio
- ⚙️ Optimize portfolio allocation to maximize return for a given risk
- 📈 Visualize Efficient Frontier
- 💡 Predictive insights using AI (optional: regression, clustering, etc.)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
   Retrieve stock price data for a basket of companies.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Compute daily returns, covariance matrix, and normalize values.

3. **Portfolio Simulation**  
   Simulate thousands of random portfolios to compare risk vs. return.

4. **Optimization**  
   Use mathematical optimization to find the best Sharpe Ratio and minimal volatility portfolio.

5. **Visualization**  
   Generate plots for efficient frontier, risk-return scatter, and optimal portfolio weights.
